# Tutorials
This repo contains the specific tutorials and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) we worked out on how to submit datasets to mARS.

The tutorials show how microbial sequence data, environmental data and metadata needs to be structured an re-arranged to archive on online repositories.

By following these tutorials step by step, you will be able to 1) register your dataset and metadata on GBIF, and 2) format you environmental data and other relevant information into a MIxS-compliable format. 
In addition, 3) the Sequence submission tutorial outlines how datasubmission to mARS integrates with sequence submission to one of the International Nucleodite Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) databases. More specifically, this tutorial shows sequences can be submitted to an online repository (SRA database of NCBI), using the MIxS-compatible metadata files generated for mARS.

All files are available as R-markdown or PDF.
